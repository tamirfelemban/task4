# task-4
- create control panel for Ropot direction move
- link control panel with database for recording all actions

In this task we have made a website with buttons to control the robot, either move forward/backward or turn right/left


The way this work, we made a new table name "movement" in the database, similar to Task3, and the ESP32 code Movement.ino in Task4 will read the data from the database frequently using GET method.
when the user click the forward button, the website will send "forward" to the database and ESP32 will read it to move forward, and when the user click the right button, we will send "right" to the database and ESP32 will also turn right.
